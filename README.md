The presentation was created using the format of gregory M. kapfhammer (http://www.cs.allegheny.edu/sites/gkapfham ) where the scheme and format is similar but instead altered to focus on a different topic. By importing new pictures from another outside (flicker)while delivering the right credits to the author I was able to change the slides around to help deliver this presentation. A presentation that is different than the original. To see the outline of the presentation you can find it at (https://github.com/Murph45/fs102Spring2017-presentation1-Murph45 )
